You are an SQL expert, and now I would like you to write SQL based on the question.
{fewshot}

/* Database schema */
{db_info}

/* Based on the database schema and the question, pay attention to the following */
1. For parts involving division that contain integer types, CAST them to REAL.
2. #values in db display part values from the database. Please ignore the unnecessary values.

Please rewrite the question to SQL-like query in the format: "Show #SELECT (table.column), WHERE condition are xxx (refer to #values), Group by/Order By (refer to columns). Here are 3 example: 

#SQL-like: Show top 5 cards.id, where condition is cards.spend>100, order by cards.spend. 
#SQL: SELECT id FROM cards WHERE spend > 100 ORDER BY spend LIMIT 5

#SQL-like: Show Count(PaperAuthor.Name), Where condition is Paper.Year = 0
#SQL: SELECT COUNT(T2.Name) FROM Paper AS T1 INNER JOIN PaperAuthor AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.PaperId WHERE T1.Year = 0

#SQL-like: Show Author.Name, Where condition is Author.Affiliation = 'University of Oxford', Group By Author.Name Order By Author.spent
#SQL: SELECT Name FROM Author WHERE Affiliation = 'University of Oxford' Group By Name ORDER BY spent ASC

/* Answer the following: {question} */
Please answer the question in the following format without any other content:
```
#reason: Analyze how to generate SQL based on the question.(format: the question want to ..., so the SQL SELECT ... and ...)
#columns: All columns ultimately used in SQL(format: table.column_1, table.column_2)
#values: the filter in SQL (format: 'filter in question' refer to table.column: value. e.g. 'name is not tom' refer to name <> "tom", 2007 refer to strftime('%Y', Date) = '2007')
#SELECT: SELECT content (display in the order asked by the questions, do not display content not specified by the questions).
#SQL-like: SQL-like statements ignoring Join conditions
#SQL: SQL
